## How to run mock API

After completing the Setup instructions, to run the mock backend (json-server), run the following command at the root of the project;

```

## Notes

- MUI version ^6 was chosen for this submission. To that end, I used Next.js version ^15 as latest stable (version ^16) is not supported by MUI version ^6.
- json-server was chosen as the mock api backend.
- https://www.mockaroo.com/ was used to generate the mock data.
